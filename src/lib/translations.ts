                q: "What makes 'Bioactive' collagen different from regular collagen?",
                a: "Bioactive peptides are enzymatically broken down into smaller, specific molecular chains. This makes them much easier for your body to absorb (high bioavailability) and ensures they can effectively target specific areas like skin cells or joint cartilage.",
            },
            q2: {
                q: "How long will it take before I see results?",
                a: "While every body is different, most users begin to notice improved skin hydration and nail strength within 4–6 weeks. For joint support and hair growth, consistent use for 8–12 weeks is typically recommended to see significant changes.",

                q: "Can I mix this into hot coffee or soup?",
                a: "Absolutely. Our collagen is heat-stable, meaning the nutritional benefits won't be lost in hot liquids. It is designed to dissolve smoothly in both hot coffee and cold smoothies without clumping.",
            },
            q5: {
                q: "Why are there 18 amino acids?",
                a: "Collagen is unique because of its high concentration of specific amino acids like Glycine, Proline, and Hydroxyproline. These 18 amino acids work together to repair connective tissue and support the metabolic functions of the skin and joints.",
            },
            q6: {
                q: "Where is the collagen sourced from?",
                a: "Nutrigen+ is sourced from premium grass-fed bovine (or pristine North Atlantic fish for our Marine line). This ensures a high-quality, clean protein source that is free from the hormones and antibiotics often found in grain-fed alternatives.",
